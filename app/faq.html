          <h4>What is egg donation?</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              Egg donation builds families. It helps those who are unable to
              become parents on their own.
            </p>
            <p>
              People choose egg donation for different reasons—some are
              struggling with infertility, others are same-sex couples or
              single individuals.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="item" data-aos="fade-up">
          <h4>How long does the whole process take?</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              It’s important to understand that egg donation timelines vary.
              While there is no guarantee you will be chosen as an egg donor,
              it is possible to be chosen within days of being accepted into
              our program. Some intended parents also require a gestational
              surrogate. This means that even after you are matched, there can
              be a waiting period while your intended parents are being
              matched with a surrogate. Although the donation itself lasts
              only 3-4 weeks, commitment to the process is typically 3-4
              months. Please keep in mind that these are average timelines and
              that no two egg donation arrangements are the same. Timelines
              are often determined by factors particular to your egg donation
              arrangement.

          <h4>How many times can I donate with Oocyt?</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              Most of our clinics will only allow an egg donor to participate
              in an egg donation five to six times. However, we can only
              rematch you if the previous donation resulted in a pregnancy or
              a successful retrieval.

          </h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              We require a minimum of 3, but you can send as many pictures as
              you want. We do require that one needs to be a recent close-up
              of your face and one needs to be a recent photo of your full
              body. If you choose, childhood photos or photos of your children
              or family are also welcomed. While selfies are easy to take,
              they don't always accurately capture you (especially when taken
              in a car). If possible, please have a friend or family member
              take your photos so you get the best quality and reflection of
              who you are.

            <p>
              Egg donors in our program must be between 21-27 years of age.
              The reproductive endocrinologists and clinics that we work with
              set the standards.

              Yes, if you know your biological families health history.
              Unfortunately, if your adoption was closed you may not be able
              to provide us with all of the necessary medical information.

          <div>
            <p>
              Yes, but it depends on the form of birth control you are using.
              Acceptable forms of birth control include birth control pills,
              the nuva ring, the patch, and non-copper IUDs. If you have an
              IUD, you are eligible to apply under the condition that you have
              it removed upon matching
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are currently using Implanon or Depo-Provera for birth
              control you will need to switch to one of the acceptable forms
              listed above and have at least three menstrual cycles before
              applying to become a donor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Always remember to consult your OB/GYN before making any
              decisions about changing your contraceptive

              Our egg donors are screened by a licensed clinical Lab. We ask
              questions to learn more about your desire to donate your eggs
              and to ensure you fully understand the process. You will also
              take a standardized psychological test, the purpose of the test
              is to identify any possible illnesses, emotional problems and
              personality disorders.

              The matching for each process is the same and you are able to

            <p>
              Known Donation: We can set up communication between all parties,
              and you can carry on the relationship to your agreed upon level
              of comfort. For example, you can meet and exchange information
              to be in touch in the future, if necessary, or can form a
              relationship and have consistent contact. Our TEAM will discuss
              this further and answer any questions in your screening.
            </p>
            <p>
              Semi-Known Donation: You donate your eggs and limit the amount
              of information that is shared. For example, you can decide that
              you don't want to exchange information but may want to meet in
              person at our office.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anonymous Donation: You would not have open contact or
              communication with the couple or single to whom you agree to
              donate. The contract would use only first names, and all
              information is exchanged through our agency. We ask that you
              keep our agency informed of all changes in your health history
              and keep your contact information up to date.

              Medications are given to suppress the menstrual cycle and
              ovarian stimulating medications are given to stimulate the
              production of eggs. Most of these medications are injections and
              are administered for 2 weeks (this can vary) until retrieval.
              The retrieval is done vaginally under a mild intravenous (IV)
              sedation. The retrieval takes about 20 minutes with about an
              hour in the recovery room. Afterwards you may experience some
              mild cramping, bleeding, or bloating.

          <div>
            <p>
              Medications are used to coordinate cycles, suppress ovulation,
              stimulate follicles, and to trigger release of eggs. Examples of
              these include birth control pills, Lupron, Ganirelix, Follistim,
              Gonal-F, Menopur and HCG. These may be used in different
              combinations depending on the clinic and physician and some of
              the medications can be known by various names.

          <h4>Are there any complications of which I should be aware?</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              Most women experience little to no complications. You can
              experience minor discomfort after the procedure, or symptoms
              associated with your natural cycles, such as headaches,
              moodiness, or cramping. There have been a very small number of
              extreme cases of hyper stimulation. Although it has never
              happened in our program, there is a need to disclose that there
              have been very rare and extremely limited cases of infertility
              or death.

          <h4>Will donating affect my own fertility?</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              No relationship between egg donation and future fertility has
              been clearly established, although research is continuing. Egg
              donation does not deplete your ovarian reserve. Each month you
              release a number of eggs, but only one comes to maturity,
              generally. The hormones administered in the donation process
              stimulate more than one to reach maturity. Women in their 20s
              have hundreds of thousands of viable eggs.
